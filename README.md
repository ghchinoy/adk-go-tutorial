# Agent Development Kit (ADK) for Go - Samples & Tutorials

**Note:** This tutorial series utilizes Google Cloud's Vertex AI for its Generative AI models and requires a Google Cloud Project with the Vertex AI API enabled.

This repository contains a comprehensive set of tutorials and experimental samples for learning how to build intelligent agents using the [Agent Development Kit (ADK) for Go](https://github.com/googleapis/adk-go).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   **Go**: Version 1.22 or higher.
*   **Google Cloud Project**: You need a Google Cloud project with Vertex AI enabled to use Gemini models.
*   **Authentication**: Set up Application Default Credentials (ADC) or provide an API key if supported by your specific setup.
    ```bash
    gcloud auth application-default login
    ```

### Installation

1.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ghchinoy/adk-go-samples.git
    cd adk-go-samples
    ```

2.  Ensure you have access to the ADK Go SDK. If it's not yet publicly available, you may need to configure `go.mod` replacements to point to your local copy, as seen in the individual tutorial setups.

## Tutorials

The `docs/tutorials` directory contains step-by-step guides progressing from basic to advanced concepts.

| # | Tutorial | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 01 | [Quickstart](docs/tutorials/01_quickstart.md) | Build your first basic agent and run it with a CLI launcher. |
| 02 | [Custom Tools](docs/tutorials/02_custom_tools.md) | Extend your agent's capabilities by letting it call local Go functions. |
| 03 | [Session State](docs/tutorials/03_session_state.md) | Learn how agents maintain state across multiple turns in a conversation. |
| 04 | [Sequential Orchestration](docs/tutorials/04_sequential_orchestration.md) | Chain multiple agents together to perform multi-step tasks. |
| 05 | [Parallel Orchestration](docs/tutorials/05_parallel_orchestration.md) | Run agents concurrently for efficient sub-task processing. |
| 06 | [Loops and Conditions](docs/tutorials/06_loops_and_conditions.md) | Implement complex, dynamic flows using standard control structures. |
| 07 | [Artifacts](docs/tutorials/07_artifacts.md) | Manage large files and binary data generated by agents. |
| 08 | [Human-in-the-Loop](docs/tutorials/08_human_in_the_loop.md) | Integrate human feedback and confirmation into agent workflows. |
| 09 | [Long-term Memory](docs/tutorials/09_long_term_memory.md) | Enable agents to retain and recall information across different sessions. |

## Repository Structure

*   `docs/`: Contains all documentation, including the tutorials listed above and other conceptual primers.
*   `experiments/`: Contains the actual Go code for each tutorial. Each experiment is a self-contained Go module (or can be treated as one) demonstrating the concepts from its corresponding tutorial.

## Running Experiments

All experiments use the standard ADK launcher, which supports multiple modes of operation.

First, set your environment variables:
```bash
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your-project-id
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=us-central1 # or your preferred region
```

Navigate to an experiment directory:
```bash
cd experiments/quickstart
```

### 1. Interactive Console Mode
This is the best way to test an agent manually. It opens an interactive session where you can chat with the agent.
```bash
go run main.go console
```

### 2. Web Server Mode
Runs the agent as a REST API server (default port 8080).
```bash
go run main.go web
```
You can then send requests:
```bash
curl -X POST -d '{"prompt": "Hello"}' http://localhost:8080/api/v1/turn
```

### 3. Single-Turn (Piping Input)
For quick, non-interactive testing, you can pipe input directly to the console mode.
```bash
printf "What time is it in Tokyo?\n" | go run main.go console
```

## Interactive Tutorial with Gemini CLI

This repository is optimized for the [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli). For a guided, hands-on learning experience, open this folder in Gemini CLI and ask:

> "Teach me how to use the Go ADK SDK using this repository."

The agent will walk you through each experiment, handling the configuration and execution steps for you.
